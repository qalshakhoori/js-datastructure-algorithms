// Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.

// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
'Implement addition';

// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
'Integers?';

// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
'Integers';

// 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
'Yes';

// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
'sum, num1, num2';

function sum(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
